# Renderings review 1 (Ruth): English renderings, overrides, look-alike notes

Reviewer: content subagent, 2026-10-22. I read all 1,306 token rows of `docs/review/ruth-renderings.md`, plus
`pipeline/english.py` and `pipeline/overrides/ruth.json`. I checked BDB on Sefaria with `curl` against
`/api/words/<form>?lookup_ref=Ruth x:y`, which worked; Python's urllib got a 403. Page numbers come from each
lexeme's `bdb.page` in `data/ruth.js` unless marked "(mem.)", meaning from memory and UNVERIFIED.
**VERIFIED (Sef.)** means I read the quoted BDB wording on Sefaria. **VERIFIED (data)** means the row output
or the code shows the problem directly. I did not report anything the brief lists as a convention: tense from
conjugation, "you (f)", two senses, literal articles, k/q neutrality.

Totals: **MUST-FIX 8 findings (11 tokens) · SHOULD-FIX 23 findings (~40 tokens) · MINOR 12.**

## 1. Findings table

| # | id(s) | current | proposed `en` | sev | label · source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 08j1i (1:11), 089gS (1:21) | to what? | why? | MUST | VERIFIED (Sef.): BDB מָה 4.d, "לָמָּה … for what reason? why?", p. 552–554 |
| 2 | 084W9 (1:13) | you (f pl) will shut oneself off | you (f pl) will shut yourselves off | MUST | VERIFIED (Sef.): BDB עָגַן p. 723, "would ye shut yourselves off" (Ru 1:13) |
| 3 | 0875P (1:11) | in my inner parts / wombs | in my womb / inner parts | MUST | VERIFIED (Sef.): BDB מֵעֶה p. 588 "only pl."; sense 3 "= womb … Ru 1:11". `pluralize` makes "wombs". Add `_number_glosses` H4578 `p: "womb / inner parts"` |
| 4 | 081bY (4:4) | exception you | except you / besides you | MUST | VERIFIED (Sef.): BDB זוּלָה p. 265 "prep. except, besides … Ru 4:4". The code appends the object pronoun to a non-noun |
| 5 | 083iR (2:9) | your (f) touching | touching you (f) | MUST | VERIFIED (data): the suffix is the object of נָגַע ("not to touch you"). The possessive reverses who touches whom. The cause: after לְבִלְתִּי, `to_inf` is false, so the suffix becomes a possessive |
| 6 | 08LGP (4:9), 08cog (4:10), 08Vgg (4:11) | witness | witnesses | MUST | VERIFIED (data): עֵדִים is mp. The bug is `pluralize()`, which skips any gloss ending in "s" ("witness"). BDB עֵד p. 729 |
| 7 | 084Ed (4:8) | to/for you (f) | to/for you | MUST | VERIFIED (Sef. text): קְנֵה־לָ֑ךְ carries athnach, so it is the pausal **2ms** (said to Boaz). OSHB/data tag it 2fs. This is a parse error, not a gender convention |
| 8 | 08sHf (1:13) | he was bitter | it was bitter | MUST | VERIFIED (Sef.): BDB מָרַר p. 600, "impers. מַר־לִי מְאֹד מִכֶּם Ru 1:13 it is very bitter to me". "he" points the learner to a person or to God |
| 9 | 08GmF (2:11) | he was told | it was told | SHOULD | VERIFIED (data): impersonal Hophal ("it has been fully told to me"). Same class as #8 |
| 10 | 08F88 (2:3) | and he happened / befell | and it happened / befell | SHOULD | VERIFIED (data): the subject is מִקְרֶהָ "her chance" (m). BDB קָרָה p. 899 |
| 11 | 08TW6 (1:13) | she went out | it went out | SHOULD | VERIFIED (data): the subject is יַד יְהוָה (f). "she" reads as Naomi |
| 12 | 08W7V (2:12) | and let her be | and let it be | SHOULD | VERIFIED (data): the subject is מַשְׂכֻּרְתֵּךְ "your wage" (f) |
| 13 | 08H3W (3:1), 08hvK (3:7) | he will be good / and he was good | it will be good / and it was good | SHOULD | VERIFIED (data): 3:1 is impersonal "that it may be well for you"; in 3:7 the subject is לִבּוֹ. BDB יָטַב p. 405 |
| 14 | 08bJa (3:18), 08eWk (4:10), 08j2a (4:14) | he will fall / he will be cut off / and he will be called | it will fall / it will be cut off / and it will be called | SHOULD | VERIFIED (data): the subjects are דָּבָר and שֵׁם (twice). With "he", "he will be called his name" misleads |
| 15 | 08pu1 (4:15) | and it will be | and he will be | SHOULD | VERIFIED (data): the subject is the child ("he shall be to you a restorer"). The forced `H1961 3ms → "it"` rule is wrong here |
| 16 | 08vdQ (2:19) | let it be | let him be | SHOULD | VERIFIED (data): יְהִי מַכִּירֵךְ בָרוּךְ, "may the one who noticed you be blessed". Same forced "it" rule |
| 17 | 085KE (1:19) | and she made noise | and she was in a stir | SHOULD | VERIFIED (Sef.): BDB הוּם p. 223 Niph. "be in a stir, of a city Ru 1:19". This is the wrong stem sense; add `_stems` H1949 `N: "to be in a stir"`. ("it" would also suit עִיר, as in #11) |
| 18 | 08w4T (2:14) | and he served | and he held out | SHOULD | VERIFIED (Sef.): BDB צָבַט p. 840, "vb. reach, hold out, to (ל pers.)", with only Ru 2:14. "serve" is not in BDB, so change the gloss H6642 to "to reach, hold out" |
| 19 | 08NQN (1:4) | and they lifted | and they took (as wives) | SHOULD | VERIFIED (Sef.): BDB נָשָׂא p. 669–672, 3.d "take as wife … Ru 1:4". The headword is "lift, carry, take". "they lifted women" misleads |
| 20 | 08pww (3:3) | you (f) should be known | you (f) should make yourself known | SHOULD | VERIFIED (Sef.): BDB יָדַע Niph. 2 "make oneself known, of pers., sq. לְ Ru 3:3", p. 393–394 |
| 21 | 08Azu (2:5) | to who? | whose? / to whom? | SHOULD | VERIFIED (Sef.): BDB מִי p. 566, "לְמִי to whom? whose?" "to who?" is broken English |
| 22 | 08PTT (4:4) | nothing | there is not / none | SHOULD | VERIFIED (Sef.): BDB אַיִן p. 34–35, "denying existence … there is none". Systemic for אֵין used as a particle |
| 23 | 08cgg (3:2) | our kinsman | our kindred | SHOULD | VERIFIED (Sef.): BDB מֹדַעַת p. 396, "n.f. kindred, kinship … Ru 3:2 is not Boaz (of) our kindred?" Fix the gloss H4130. "kinsman" also collides with מוֹדַע at 2:1 Qr |
| 24 | 085gQ (1:4), 08Mjg (2:17) | like ten / like ephah | about ten / about ephah | SHOULD | UNVERIFIED (Sef. lookup of כְּ returned nothing): BDB כְּ p. 453 (mem.), "with numbers: about". "like ten years" misleads |
| 25 | 08cK8 (1:19) | like their (f) coming (in) | as their (f) coming (in) | SHOULD | UNVERIFIED: BDB כְּ with inf. "when, as" p. 454–455 (mem.). Systemic: H9004 + infinitive construct |
| 26 | 08ssA (4:16) | to nurse | as nurse / for a nurse | SHOULD | VERIFIED (data): "to nurse" reads as an English infinitive. BDB אָמַן p. 52 ptc. "nurse", and לְ "for, as" (mem.) |
| 27 | 08tKf, 08D3a (2:5, 6) | the one being stationed (over) | the one stationed (over) | SHOULD | VERIFIED (Sef.): BDB נָצַב p. 662 Niph. 2 "be stationed = appointed over (על) … Ru 2:5, 6". "being" suggests a process |
| 28 | 08GzE (1:2), 083TS (1:4) | Ephrathite / Moabite | Ephrathites / Moabite (women) | SHOULD | VERIFIED (data): these are mp and fp gentilic nouns. The `lex.name` check skips pluralizing them |
| 29 | 089Dq, 08WSe (2:19), 08gLV (3:18), 08L3V (4:9), 08SmU (4:10), 08w2r (4:14) | the day | today / the day | SHOULD | VERIFIED (Sef.): BDB יוֹם p. 400, "Phrases: הַיּוֹם = to-day". QUESTIONABLE against the "articles literal" convention, but BDB lists it as a phrase, and "witnesses you are the day" is not a literal reading |
| 30 | 08WeU (4:5) | and from (object marker) | and from (with) | SHOULD | QUESTIONABLE: the data tags H853 (object marker) after מִן, so the English is broken either way. Read as אֵת "with" + מִן it is "from (with)" (BDB אֵת II p. 85–86). Not a k/q pair; it is a known crux, so offer the literal "and from" without choosing a reading |
| 31 | 08Ap3 (1:12) | I was old | I became old | SHOULD | VERIFIED (Sef.): BDB זָקֵן vb. p. 278, "be or become old … זָקַנְתִּי מִהְיוֹת לאישׁ Ru 1:12 I am too old". This keeps the past-tense convention |

MINOR (one line each, all VERIFIED (data) unless noted):
- 08S38 (2:7) "from since" should be "since". H227b's gloss already includes מִן, so add it to `COMBINED`.
- 08wJn (1:13) "being" and 08T97 (3:10) "going / walking" come after לְבִלְתִּי; "to be" and "to go" read better. #5 has the same root cause.
- 08bmv, 08doW, 0876o: "their two" should be "the two of them".
- 08WDP (2:10) אָרְצָה: "to land" should be "to (the) ground" (BDB אֶרֶץ p. 75–76, "ground").
- 086n2 (2:14) לְעֵת "to time of" should be "at time of" (לְ of time).
- 08BYa (1:7) "to there" should be "there(ward)".
- Comparative מִן: 08ddd (1:13), 084YU (3:10) and 08NH6 (4:15) "from" could be "(more) than". This is literal and acceptable, but worth a note.
- 08G2d (2:20) "from our redeemer": BDB and most readers take it as partitive, "one of our redeemers" (QUESTIONABLE).
- אֲשֶׁר is always "which", even for persons (2:19, 2:20, 4:1, 4:14). Consider "who / which".
- דָּבָר "word" in 3:18 and 4:7 means "matter" (BDB p. 182, "word, matter, thing"). Consider the gloss "word, matter".
- 08rWk (2:21) עַד אִם: "if" should be "(until) if"; BDB עַד p. 725 (mem.) has "until".
- 085oN and 08Tgd לְאִשָּׁה: "to woman / wife" could be "as woman / wife".

## 2. Override checks (against BDB)

**`_stems`** (VERIFIED (Sef.) where marked. All others UNVERIFIED but consistent with BDB as I know it, and I found nothing against them.)
- H7604 N "to be left": OK. H7663b p "to wait for": OK. H6912 N: OK. H4843 h "make bitter": OK. H7725 h "bring back": OK.
- H5702 N "to shut oneself off": **VERIFIED (Sef.)**, but rendering it needs a reflexive pronoun (finding #2).
- H5162 p "comfort": OK. H5046 H "to be told": OK, but the subject needs to be "it" (#9).
- H5234a h "to recognize, notice": QUESTIONABLE in order only. When there is an object, only the first sense is kept, so 2:10 shows "to recognize me" where BDB has "regard, take notice of". Reorder to "notice, recognize" (MINOR).
- H7999a p "repay", H3498 h "leave over", H3637 h "humiliate", H3318 h "bring out", H3190 h, H3772 N, H7121 N, H7673a h: OK.
- H3045 N "to be known": **QUESTIONABLE**. BDB Niph. sense 2 is "make oneself known … Ru 3:3" (VERIFIED (Sef.)), so 3:3 needs #20. 3:14 is overridden correctly. P "to be known" is OK, and 08ygU uses the token gloss anyway.
- H3943 N "twist, turn over": OK. H6965b h "raise up" / p "confirm": OK.
- H3205 q/P/h: OK. H7812 v "bow down": OK (BDB files the form under שָׁחָה Hithpalel, p. 1005).
- **Missing:** H1949 N "to be in a stir" (#17).

**`_number_glosses`**: H4772 OK (k singular, q plural; neutral). H430 "God / god(s)": OK and neutral. H6440 OK. H2416a OK. H2205 "elders" OK. H7934: the `why` says the spelling "neighbour" is kept apart from רֵעַ's "neighbor", but the plural override prints "neighbors", which undoes that (MINOR, QUESTIONABLE). **Missing:** H4578 (#3).

**`_participles`**: H1350a "redeemer(s)" OK (BDB p. 145, ptc. as subst.). H4191 "dead one(s)" OK. H539 "nurse" is OK as a gloss, but after לְ it renders as "to nurse" (#26).

**`_notes`**: H413 is **VERIFIED**. The data confirms אֵל (H410) is not in Ruth, and the BDB pages (אֶל p. 39, אַל p. 39, אֵל p. 42) agree with the data's `bdb.page` for H413 and H408. H408 is **VERIFIED**: אַל תִּקְרֶאנָה is at 1:20 (08ta1, 08JnD).

**`_renderings`**:
- 08Uv6 "let it be known": **VERIFIED**, impersonal Niphal jussive (BDB p. 393).
- 08CGY "formerly": **VERIFIED (Sef.)**, BDB פָּנֶה 6, "adv. temp. לְפָנִים formerly" (p. 816).
- 08jGA "to one bringing back": **VERIFIED** in substance (Hiph. ptc. "restorer").

**`_token_glosses`** 08ygU "acquaintance, known one": **VERIFIED (Sef.)**, BDB יָדַע Pu. "elsewhere as subst. = acquaintance … Kt מידע Ru 2:1 (Qr מוֹדַע)".

**Gloss changes:**
- H8252 "to be quiet, rest": **VERIFIED (Sef.)**, BDB שָׁקַט p. 1052, "be quiet, undisturbed … of Boaz Ru 3:18 he will not be quiet until he has finished".
- H7646 "to be satisfied": **VERIFIED (Sef.)**, BDB שָׂבֵעַ p. 959, "be sated, satisfied, surfeited".

**Other gloss problems found while reading** (data-level, not renderings):
- H6642 "to serve" is not a BDB sense (#18).
- H4130 "kinsman" should be "kindred" (#23).
- H1949 "to make noise" is the Qal-ish sense (#17).

## 3. Proposed look-alike notes (10)

None of these lexemes is in Ruth. I checked each Strong's key against `data/ruth.js` lexemes. I confirmed each meaning
in the BDB on Sefaria. The page numbers are from memory, so they are UNVERIFIED.

| Ruth word | Not to confuse with (not in Ruth) | Note text (draft) | BDB |
|---|---|---|---|
| אִישׁ man | **אֵשׁ** "fire" (~375×) | Not אֵשׁ "fire" (tsere, no yod). | p. 77 (mem.) |
| אִשָּׁה woman | **אִשֶּׁה** "offering by fire" (~65×) | Not אִשֶּׁה (segol, final he), "offering made by fire", common in Leviticus. | p. 77 (mem.) |
| לֶחֶם food, bread | **לָחַם / נִלְחַם** "fight" (~170×) | Same consonants; the verb "fight, do battle" is mostly Niphal. | p. 535 (mem.) |
| דָּבָר word | **דֶּבֶר** "pestilence" (~50×) | Same consonants; segol–segol, "plague". | p. 184 (mem.) |
| יוֹם day | **יָם** "sea" (~390×) | יָמִים "days" vs. יַמִּים "seas" (dagesh). | p. 410 (mem.) |
| רֵעַ neighbor | **רַע** "bad, evil" (~350×) | Not רַע "evil" (patach, no furtive). | p. 948 (mem.) |
| הָיָה to be | **חָיָה** "to live" (~280×) | ה vs. ח: "be" vs. "live". | p. 310 (mem.) |
| גָּאַל redeem | **גָּאַל II** "defile" (~11×) | A homograph; "defile" is late and rare. Never "redeem" in Is 59:3, La 4:14. | p. 146 (mem.) |
| קָרָא call | **קָרָא II** "encounter, befall" (in לִקְרַאת "to meet", ~120×) | Same root letters; the "meet" sense parallels קָרָה (2:3). | p. 896 (mem.) |
| אֲשֶׁר which | **אַשּׁוּר** "Assyria" (~150×) | Not אַשּׁוּר "Asshur/Assyria" (patach, dagesh in shin). | p. 78 (mem.) |

(Also worth listing, though both words are in Ruth and do not share consonants, so the automatic list misses
them: לָקַח "take" vs. לָקַט "glean", and וַתָּשָׁב "she returned" vs. וַתֵּשֶׁב "she sat".)

## 4. Systemic causes in `english.py` (for the fixer)
1. A 3rd-person subject comes from the parse only. Inanimate or impersonal subjects get "he" or "she" (#8–#14). The forced `H1961 3ms → it` rule fails where the subject is a person (#15, #16). Per-token `_renderings` are the safe fix, since the code cannot see the subject.
2. `pluralize`: `noun.endswith("s")` skips "witness" (#6). Gentilic nouns are never pluralized (#28).
3. A suffix on an infinitive after a preposition other than לְ becomes a possessive even when it is the object (#5). After לְבִלְתִּי, the infinitive gets "-ing" (MINOR).
4. A non-noun with a suffix appends the object pronoun ("exception you", #4).
5. Reflexive Niphal stem glosses ("oneself") are not inflected for person (#2).
6. `PREFIX_EN` כְּ = "like" before numbers and infinitives (#24, #25). לְ = "to" before a participle used as a noun (#26).

## Confirmation pass (commit cd15d24)

Method: I rebuilt the compact listing of the regenerated `docs/review/ruth-renderings.md` (still 1,306 rows) and
diffed the English column against my first-pass copy. 96 rows changed; the other 1,210 are identical. I also read
the new override entries in `pipeline/overrides/ruth.json`. The labels below are VERIFIED (data): I saw each row.

**MUST-FIX #1–8: all fixed.**
- #1 08j1i, 089gS: "why?". #2 084W9: "shut yourselves off". #3 0875P: "in my womb / inner parts", with `_number_glosses` H4578 added.
- #4 081bY: "except you". #5 083iR: "touching you (f)". #6 08LGP, 08cog, 08Vgg: "witnesses" (rule fix). #7 084Ed: "to/for you". #8 08sHf: "it was bitter".

**SHOULD-FIX #9–31: 22 fixed, 1 fixed with a problem.**
- Fixed: #9–16 (every "it" and "he" subject correction, including 08pu1 "and he will be" and 08vdQ "let him be"); #17 085KE "was in a stir" (`_stems` H1949 N added); #18 08w4T "reached / held out" (gloss H6642); #19 08NQN; #20 08pww; #21 08Azu "whose?"; #22 08PTT "there is not"; #23 08cgg "our kindred" (gloss H4130); #25 08cK8 "as their (f) coming (in)"; #26 08ssA "as nurse"; #27 08tKf, 08D3a "the one stationed (over)"; #28 "Ephrathites" and "Moabites"; #29 all six הַיּוֹם rows are now "today"; #30 08WeU "and from (אֵת)", which works, stays neutral and does not pick a reading of the crux; #31 08Ap3 "I became old".
- **Wrongly fixed, MINOR: #24 08Mjg "about an ephah of".** כְּאֵיפָה is absolute, not construct. The added "an" and "of" smooth the text, against the "no smoothing / articles literal" convention. Propose "about ephah" or "about an ephah", without "of". 085gQ "about ten" is fine.

**MINOR items**
- Fixed: 08S38 "since"; 08wJn "to be"; 08T97 "to go / walk"; 08bmv, 08doW, 0876o "the two of them"; 086n2 "at time of"; אֲשֶׁר → "which / who"; דָּבָר → "word / matter"; 085oN, 08Tgd "as woman / wife"; H5234a reordered, so 2:10 now shows "to notice me" and 2:19 "noticing you (f)".
- 08WDP is now "to the ground". The added article is a small departure from the literal convention. I had written "(the)", so I accept it.
- Not applied, by the coordinator's choice, and still open as MINOR: 08G2d (partitive), 08rWk (עַד אִם), 08BYa ("there(ward)"), and the comparative מִן note.

**Override checks**
- `_stems` H3045 N is still "to be known". 3:3 is fixed per word in `_renderings` instead, which is adequate because Ruth has no other Niphal of the verb. My QUESTIONABLE label is resolved in practice.
- New gloss entries H6642, H4130, H369, H834a and H1697 match the BDB wording I quoted in section 1.

**Look-alike notes (12 entries plus the original 2)**
- All 12 are present, and their wording matches section 3. The pages now come from the pinned LexicalIndex, which replaces my from-memory pages. I did not re-check those pages.
- The H1350a note's references (Is 59:3, Lam 4:14) match the BDB גָּאַל II entry I read on Sefaria.
- The לָקַח/לָקַט and וַתֵּשֶׁב/וַתָּשָׁב notes are accurate: all four words occur in Ruth, at 2:3ff., 1:6/22 and 2:14.

**Regression scan**
- Plural rule: the only plural changes in the whole diff are the three עֵדִים rows and the two gentilics. No noun was double-pluralized, and none ending in "s" changed wrongly. **No regression.**
- "which / who" shows up on 38 rows. It also lands on things ("the place which / who", "the cloak which / who", "all which / who you did"). This is noisy but not wrong, under the two-senses convention. MINOR, no action needed.
- Niphal participle rule: only 08tKf, 08D3a and the Hithpael 08tkJ changed. 08tkJ "determined" for מִתְאַמֶּצֶת is fine.
- כְּ + infinitive rule: only 08cK8 changed. 08zTj כַּאֲשֶׁר is unaffected.
- הַיּוֹם rule: exactly 6 rows, and no other יוֹם form changed (בְּיוֹם, יְמֵי).
- No ketiv/qere row changed.
- **New MINOR, collision:** the single "neighbor" spelling means רֵעַ (08QZx, 08rnW) and שָׁכֵן (08wp8) now have identical English. The old "neighbour" spelling was the only thing keeping them apart. If they should stay distinct, consider "dweller nearby" for שָׁכֵן (BDB p. 1015, "inhabitant, neighbour").

**Net:** all 8 MUST-FIX and all 23 SHOULD-FIX findings are fixed, one of them (#24) with a smoothing slip. I found no regressions from the rule changes, and two new MINOR points (#24's wording and the "neighbor" collision).
